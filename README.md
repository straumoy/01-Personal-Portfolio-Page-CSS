Build a simple portfolio website using flexbox and grid to showcase your projects.
Using reference.png as a starting point for styling.
Coming from pure html coding, it's challenging to wrap my head around the workflow of 2 files.
Changing from VScode to VScodium also presented some initial challenges.
Github workflow also rusty after neglecting it for about a month.

CSS code copied & pasted just to get a proof of concept and test that things are in order.
